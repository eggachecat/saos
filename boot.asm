; Infinite loop (e9 fd ff)
loop:
    jmp loop

; When compiled , our program must fit into 512 bytes , 
; with the last two bytes being the magic number , 
; so here , tell our assembly compiler to pad out our 
; program with enough zero bytes (db 0) to bring us to 
; 510 th byte.

; total 512 reserve 2 bytes ===> 510
; $-$$ for statment size

;DB - Define Byte. 8 bits
;DW - Define Word. Generally 2 bytes on a typical x86 32-bit system
;DD - Define double word. Generally 4 bytes on a typical x86 32-bit system

times 510-($-$$) db 0
